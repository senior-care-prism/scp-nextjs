  publishedDate: '2021-03-31 10:23:54-07',

  tags: ['news', 'fun'],
  content: `CIHI (Canadian Institute for Health Information) and the National Institute on Ageing (NIA) have released an urgent new report detailing the fatal impact of the first and second waves of COVID-19 on seniors in Canadian long-term care homes. The report, entitled ‘The Impact of COVID-19 on Long-Term Care in Canada: Focus on the First 6 Months’ presents new data measuring Canada’s response in protecting vulnerable residents in nursing homes, as well as a comparison to that of other countries across the globe.

  Among the findings is sobering evidence that Canada has suffered a shockingly higher proportion of deaths in long-term care (69%) than the international average (41%)—a reaffirming validation of the urgent calls for change put forth in CanAge’s policy roadmap, ‘VOICES: A Roadmap to an Age-Inclusive Canada.’
  
  Alarmingly, the report points to the second wave taking an even harsher toll than the first, leaving us extremely worried about the potentially disastrous ramifications of the imminent third wave that has already started across the country.
  
  “The findings in the new report are alarming but, unfortunately, not surprising,” says Laura Tamblyn Watts, CEO of CanAge. “We’ve been making strong recommendations to governments across the country for systemic change to prevent further loss of life among our most vulnerable older population in long-term care since the onset of the pandemic.” She goes on to warn that, “This is just one more piece of evidence on a long list that confirms the need for governments to take immediate action as we enter the third wave of COVID-19.”`,

  headline: 'CanAge applauds long-term care investment in new Nova Scotia budget—warns of critical funding gaps',
  publishedDate: '2021-03-26 10:23:54-07',

  tags: ['news', 'fun'],
  content: `Toronto ON, March 26 — CanAge, Canada’s National Seniors Advocacy Organization, is applauding the significant investments committed to long-term care in Nova Scotia’s newly announced 2021 budget while cautioning that critical funding gaps persist that threaten the lives and well-being of older people in the province.

  “There are some real wins here for vulnerable older Nova Scotians,” notes Laura Tamblyn Watts, CEO of CanAge. “The increased funding commitments to improve long-term care are as commendable as they are critically important. Unfortunately, protecting all seniors in the province isn’t the one-size-fits-all solution—there are multiple issues requiring the same degree of government action.”
  
  Among the positive outcomes for seniors in the budget are commitments to:
  
    - Invest $1.02B in long-term care (a notable increase from the previous budget), including $8.6 million for the first year of the multi-year Long Term Care Infrastructure Renewal Plan to replace or significantly renovate seven nursing homes and add more than 230 beds across the province by 2025.
    - Increase the Property Tax Rebate for Seniors program, which helps low-income seniors with the cost of municipal residential property taxes, by $1.1 million.
    - Invest $64.2 million in personal protective equipment
    - Invest $11.3 million to support nurses and additional cleaning requirements for Infection Prevention and Control
  
  However, Tamblyn Watts points to several key considerations missing from the province’s plan, including necessary action to:
  
    - Create a provincial integrated health and human resources staffing strategy across home care and LTC. Provide educational grants and paid training incentives.
    - Significantly invest in Home Care (Care at Home) as the primary provincial model of seniors’ care since so many Nova Scotians are aging at home.
    - Invest in high-speed internet in rural and underserved communities, and subsidize connectivity for those in need.
  
  Important to note is that the Government of Nova Scotia recently received a low grade of D- in a groundbreaking new report: ‘Adult Vaccination in Canada – Cross-Country Report Card 2021’—the first report of its kind in Canada. The report, published by CanAge earlier this year, used an unbiased set of criteria to assign each province and territory a letter grade on how well it protects their older residents from preventable illnesses like the flu, shingles, and pneumonia. CanAge notes serious gaps in vaccine funding, ease of access, and public awareness in the province.`,
